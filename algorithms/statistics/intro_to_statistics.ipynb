    "\n",
    "1. Data: Data refers to facts, numbers, or observations collected for analysis. It can be anything from customer purchase records to temperature readings. Data is the raw material that statisticians and data scientists work with to uncover patterns and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variable : Variables are the building blocks of statistical analysis. They help us define what we’re measuring and how we’ll analyze it. Variables are classified into two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative Variables: Numerical data that can be measured (e.g., age, income, temperature).\n",
    "Qualitative Variables: Categorical data that describes qualities (e.g., gender, color, product type).\n",
    "3. Population: Complete set of individuals, objects, or data points of interest in a study.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sample : Subset of the population selected for analysis. It’s used when studying the entire population is impossible or unnecessary. For instance, instead of measuring the height of every adult in a country, you might measure the height of 1,000 adults and use that data to infer information about the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Parameter: Numerical value that describes a characteristic of a population. For example, the average income of all households in a city is a parameter. Parameters are often unknown and are estimated using sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Statistic: Numerical value that describes a characteristic of a sample. For example, the average income of 100 households surveyed in a city is a statistic. Statistics are used to estimate parameters and make inferences about populations."

    "***Levels of Measurement***\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of measurement determines how data can be analyzed and what statistical techniques are appropriate. There are four levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "***1. Nominal Level***\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal data is the simplest level of measurement. It involves categorizing data into distinct groups or labels without any order or ranking. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of fruits (apple, banana, orange).\n",
    "Colors (red, blue, green).\n",
    "Nominal data is analyzed using frequency counts (e.g., how many apples vs. bananas) or the mode (the most frequently occurring category).\n",
    "\n",
    "***2. Ordinal Level***\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal data builds on nominal data by introducing order or ranking. While the categories can be ranked, the differences between them are not measurable or meaningful. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Education levels (high school, bachelor’s, master’s).\n",
    "Customer satisfaction ratings (poor, fair, good, excellent).\n",
    "Ordinal data can be summarized using the median (middle value) or mode, but not the mean (average), because the intervals between ranks are not consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "***3. Interval Level***\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval data is numerical and the differences between values are meaningful. However, it lacks a true zero point meaning zero doesn’t indicate the absence of the characteristic being measured. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between 10°C and 20°C is the same as between 30°C and 40°C\n",
    "IQ scores.\n",
    "Zero doesn’t mean “none.” For instance, 0°C doesn’t mean the absence of temperature—it’s just a point on the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval data allows for addition and subtraction but not multiplication or division because the zero point is arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "***4. Ratio Level***\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio data is the most advanced level of measurement. It has all the properties of interval data, plus a true zero point, which allows for a full range of mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero indicates the complete absence of the characteristic being measured. For example, 0 kg means no weight, and 0 income means no earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Height, weight, income.\n",
    "* Number of children in a family.\n",
